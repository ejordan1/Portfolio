            <strong>Jazz saxophonist</strong>! I love to play music with other people. Recently I have found it rewarding to be on the rhythm side of things and have been having fun learning percussion instruments.

            <strong>Half-Brazilian</strong>: Half Brazlian and speak Portuguese natively. Spent my summers in Brazil growing up.

          <li>
            <strong>Writing tutor</strong>: I worked for three years as a writing tutor at the University of Washington. I continue to use the relational and metacognitive skills I learned in this environment in much of my communication.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Game Jams</strong>: I come to every game jam (hackathon where you make a video game) I have the opportunity to and so far have participated in 10. I enjoy the feeling after programming for 25 hours straight and pulling my hood over my head and looking at the computer screen and not accomplishing anything for another five hours because I should have taken a break 23 hours and a half hours ago.
